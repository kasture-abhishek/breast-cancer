📊 Breast Cancer Prediction — Logistic Regression

This project builds a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the breast cancer dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection using correlation analysis, model training, evaluation with multiple metrics, and visualization of results.

🚀 Features

Data cleaning and label encoding

Correlation heatmap for feature selection

Train–test split and feature scaling

Logistic Regression model training

Evaluation using accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and balanced accuracy

Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Plotly

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository

Place breast-cancer.csv in the project folder

Run:

python breast-cancer.py

🎯 Objective

To demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow for classification using Logistic Regression.
